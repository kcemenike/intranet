      description: 'Eleme is perhaps the first of the FIPL plant to be constructed. It was a previously dilapidated and non-functioning power station. In 2001, the 20MW GE LM2500 Gas turbine at Eleme was refurbished and commissioned by FIPL. However, due to operational difficulties, FIPL took a pragmatic step to trade-in the old 20MW GE LM2500 and expand the capacity at this station through the procurement of 3x25MW Frame 5 Nuovo Pignone Gas turbines.',
